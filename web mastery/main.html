  <h1>How to Add Your Name</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Welcome to <strong>know me.com</strong>, a platform where you can showcase your profile and let people recognize you by your name.</p>
    
    <p>When you submit your name, please note that the developer will upload it to the website only after <strong>two weeks</strong>. This process ensures that your details are verified and correctly displayed.</p>
    
    <p>This service is <strong>completely free of charge</strong>. However, once your profile is successfully added, it <strong>cannot be updated or edited</strong>. Please make sure that you provide the correct information the first time.</p>
    
    <p>If, for any reason, you wish to remove your profile, you may request removal only after a minimum of <strong>two months</strong> from the date of upload.</p>
    
    <p>Adding your profile is very simple. At the bottom of this page, you will find a button labeled <em>Add Your Profile</em>. When you click it, you will be redirected to the developerâ€™s email address, where you can send your details directly.</p>
    
    <p>The developer will then upload your profile on <strong>know me.com</strong>. Once it is published, you will be able to search and view your name on Google.</p>
    
    <p>Please note that <strong>adding photos is not free</strong>. There is a small charge of <strong>10 INR per photo</strong> if you would like to include an image along with your profile.</p>
